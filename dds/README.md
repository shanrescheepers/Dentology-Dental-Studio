<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process
`Conceptual Process`
This term's theme of the project was an exciting one.
This idea behind Dentology Dental Studio, DDS, came from the familiarity of having a family member with his own practice.
I decided to look at his already existing management 
system, and recreate a functional Dental Studio Management Page with a clean niche look and feel to it, whilst having a simple yet easy and effective usage and user journey present.

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application, with react js, php and mysql.

### Implementation Process

<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* Utilized and implemented `React` for a dynamic web app.
Integration of `React Bootstrap` for  the UI.
* Integration of typescript and JS .
* Implemented KISS method and achieved easier scss skills. (Keep it Simple Shanre)
